## How to build

> - Make sure your computer has docker,java17 and maven installed
> - Open your terminal and enter the CreditSystem folder with the cd command
> - Run "mvn clean install -U -DskipTests=true"
> - Run "docker-compose up" 
> - Go to "http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/" from browser
> - Create a new account with /accounts end point
> - Get token by entering the account information you created with /login end point
> - Enter token by pressing the Authorize button on the top right, adding Bearer to the head of the value section
> - And now you can use all the end-pointes :blush:

### Motivation

I want to write clean, sustainable, well-defined boundary context, well-tested domain code and isolate business logic from external concerns. Hexagonal architecture allows us to become domain software, which is a very comfortable way to change technology because it provides a loosely couple environment without the technical details of the project, and it also prepares our monolith-starting project for micro-servicers

### What is the Hexagonal Architecture

The hexagonal architecture was invented by Alistair Cockburn in an attempt to avoid known structural pitfalls in object-oriented software design, such as undesired dependencies between layers and contamination of user interface code with business logic, and published in 2005.

> A timeless goal of software engineering has been to separate code that changes frequently from code that is stable.
>
> ~ James Coplien / Lean Architecture

We recommend Hexagonal Architecture for those who want to write clean, maintainable, well-defined boundary context, well-tested domain, and decoupling business logic from technical code.
